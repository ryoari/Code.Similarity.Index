## Why CSI?

The Code Similarity Index (CSI) is designed to simplify the detection of code similarity across extensive codebases. CSI is tailored to address the challenges of plagiarism detection and code quality assessment by recognizing not only exact matches but also structural and logical similarities in code. Whether you're an educator, a software developer, or a company, CSI provides a comprehensive solution to manage and assess code integrity.

## Features

- **Advanced Code Matching**: CSI leverages abstract syntax trees (AST) and machine learning models to identify code similarity, even if the code has been obfuscated or refactored.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Initially supporting Python and Java, with plans to extend compatibility to additional programming languages.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjust similarity detection settings to fine-tune between strict plagiarism detection and permissible code reuse.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive web interface for easy code uploads and detailed similarity reports.

## Project Status

We're in the early stages of development, with a goal to establish core functionality within the next month. Stay tuned for updates as we make progress!
